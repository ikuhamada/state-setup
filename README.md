This is a part of the STATE example for the Asia computational materials design (ACMD) workshop at Phenikaa University, Vietnam.

To set up the environment for the hands-on in the ACMD workshop, execute the following command in the home directory:

```bash
git clone -b acmd_pka_2022 https://github.com/ikuhamada/state-setup.git STATE
```

to get the ``STATE`` directory. Then, go to the ``STATE`` directory

```bash
cd STATE
```

and run ``state-setup.sh``

```bash
./state-setup.sh
```

One can find the ``examples`` directory containing the examples used in the hands-on tutorial. The source files can be found in ``src`` and the pseudopotetials can be found in ``gncpp``.
